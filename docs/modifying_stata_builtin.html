      <h1 id="header_content">Modifying a Built-in Stata Command</h1>

      <p>
        I recently came across an issue in which modifying a shipped-with-Stata
        command was the easier way to address. I’m writing this to document the
        approach I took in case it comes up again and proves useful to remember
        the steps I took.
      </p>

      <p>
        (Note: If you see <code>...</code> in Stata code snippets below, it
        indicates portions of code I excluded for brevity.)
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="the-problem">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>

      <p>
        A client was working with survival data and using the <code>sts
        test</code> command to show that the number of observed and expected
        events was similar. The <code>sts test</code> command produces a
        p-value, as shown below, but the journal the client was submitting to
        rightly prefers confidence intervals over p-values. So the client was
        hoping to bootstrap <code>sts test</code> to generate confidence
        intervals for the expected number of events. The problem was
        that <code>sts test</code> returns very little information and thus
        bootstrap wouldn’t work as normal (as it requires <code>return</code>’d
        or <code>ereturn</code>’d values to operate).

      <p>
        While I could probably have figured out the math that Stata uses to
        calculate those expected events, it seemed probably easier and
        definitely more fun to hack the <code>sts test</code> command.

      <h2>Finding Where to Modify</h2>

      <p>
        The <code>which</code> command will tell you whether a command exists in
        an ado file, or is “built-in”, which cannot be modified as easily. Since
        the “test” of <code>sts test</code> is a subcommand, we can find
        where <code>sts</code> is defined.
      </p>

      <pre>. which sts
/Applications/Stata/ado/base/s/sts.ado
*! version 8.8.0  23apr2022</pre>

      <p>
        Opening that file, I quickly found the <code>test</code> subcommand:
      </p>

      <pre>program define Test, rclass
...</pre>

      <p>
        Searching the file for “Expected” or “events” or any other text in
        the <code>sts test</code> output came up blank, so the actual
        calcuations must take place elsewhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <code>sts test</code> command runs a variety of different tests, and
        I noticed that a good chunk of the code was dedicated to determining
        which test the user request, and setting the <code>cmd</code> macro.
      </p>

      <pre>...
    else if "`tware'"~="" {
        local cmd "tware_st"
    }
...
    else if "`peto'"~="" {
        local cmd "peto_st"
    }
...
    else    local cmd "logrank"
...</pre>

      <p>
        Finally, near the bottom of the command, the <code>cmd</code> macro is
        used:
      </p>

      <pre>...
    `vv' `cmd' _t _d `w' if `touse', strata(`strata') /*
        */ t0(_t0) `id' `by' `options' `detail' `trend' `p' `q'
...</pre>

      <p>
        Ignoring the <code>vv</code> macro (which handles <code>version</code>
        if applicable), it’s clear that the <code>cmd</code> macro must be an
        actual command. And the particular test the client was working with was
        the logrank test, therefore I was looking for the <code>logrank</code>
        command.
      </p>

      <pre>. which logrank
/Applications/Stata/ado/base/l/logrank.ado
*! version 7.1.17  10nov2021</pre>

      <p>
        Inside I found the following code:
      </p>

      <pre>...
  di in smcl in gr _n _col(`len') `" {c |}  Observed       Expected"'
    local pad = `len' - `len1'
    if `"`strata'"'==`""' { local dup `"     events"' }
    else    local dup `"     events*"'
    di in smcl in gr `"`ttl'"' _skip(`pad') `"{c |}    events    `dup'"'
    di in smcl in gr "{hline `len'}{c +}{hline 25}"


    local sum 0
    local i 1
    local gstr = (bsubstr("`:type `grp''", 1, 3)=="str")
    while `i' <= _N {
        if (`gstr') {
            local x : di udsubstr(`grp'[`i'], 1, 255)
        }
        else {
            local x = `grp'[`i']
        }
        local pad = `len' - udstrlen(`"`x'"')-1
        di in smcl in gr _skip(`pad') `"`x' "' "{c |}" in ye /*
            */ %10.0g `wo'[1,`i'] `"     "' %10.2f `w'[1,`i']
        local sum = `sum' + `wo'[1,`i']
        local i = `i' + 1
    }
    di in smcl in gr "{hline `len'}{c +}{hline 25}"
        local pad = `len' - 6
    di in smcl in gr _skip(`pad') `"Total "' `"{c |}"' in ye /*
            */ %10.0g `sum' `"     "' %10.2f `sum'
...</pre>

      <p>
        This is very confusing code to look at at first (for some reason all
        shipped-with-Stata code uses the shortest possible versions of the
        command names, making things even more obtuse) but we can tell that this
        is producing the table output we’re looking for. <code>di</code>
        is <code>display</code>, so each <code>di</code> line is printing
        something out. The first couple are printing “Observed”, “Expected”, and
        “events”, so that’s the head of the table, and the last <code>di</code>
        is printing “Total” which is the end of the table. The <code>sts
        test</code> (and <code>logrank</code>) command takes in a categorical
        variable and prints a row per level, so the <code>while</code> loop must
        be going through each level of the variable. Inside the loop, there is
        only a single <code>di</code> statement:
      </p>

      <pre>...
        di in smcl in gr _skip(`pad') `"`x' "' "{c |}" in ye /*
            */ %10.0g `wo'[1,`i'] `"     "' %10.2f `w'[1,`i']
...</pre>

      <p>
        Note the reference to two matrix extractions: <code>wo[1, i]</code>
        and <code>w[1, i]</code>. These insert the observed (<code>wo</code>)
        and expected (<code>w</code>) number of events!
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="making-the-modification">
      <h2>Making the Modification</h2>

      <p>
        So ultimately, we just need to return the <code>w</code> matrix. Finding
        the other returns,
      </p>

      <pre>...
    ret scalar df = colsof(`w') - 1
    ret scalar chi2 = `V'[1,1]
...</pre>

      <p>
        we can add our own return that stores each expected value into a scalar:
      </p>

      <pre>  matrix events=`w'
  local i 1
  while `i' <= _N {
    return scalar e`i' = events[1,`i']
    local i = `i' + 1
  }</pre>

      <p>Now we can save this, re-open Stata, and it works!</p>

      <h2>An Added Complication</h2>

      <p>
        The client was working on a virtual Windows machine which did not have
        permission to overwrite the logrank.ado file. It is easy enough to make
        a copy of logrank.ado, rename <code>logrank</code>
        to <code>logrank2</code> and treat it as a user-written ado file, but
        we’d have to also create a custom version of <code>sts test</code> which
        might be slightly messy due to it being a subcommand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, we can use the sts.ado to figure out to get the comparable
        <code>logrank</code> command for a given <code>sts test</code> command.
      </p>

      <pre>...
    `vv' `cmd' _t _d `w' if `touse', strata(`strata') /*
        */ t0(_t0) `id' `by' `options' `detail' `trend' `p' `q'
...</pre>

      <p>
        As mentioned above, <code>vv</code> is just version control, so here we have
        some variables passed to <code>logrank</code> (<code>_t</code>,
        <code>_d</code>, and whatever is inside <code>w</code>), and a bunch of
        options. We can modify our version of <code>logrank</code> to print out
        all these, to determine what is actually being passed.
      </p>

      <pre>program define logrank /* timevar [deadvar] [, by(group) t0(t0) id(tvid)] */, rclass
    version 6.0, missing
    syntax varlist(min=1 max=2) [if] [in] [fw iw] [, /*
        */ BY(varlist) CHECK Detail ID(varname) LOGRANK /*
        */ MAT(string) T0(varname) noTItle /*
        */ STrata(varlist) TVid(varname) trend DINOTE]

display "varlist: `varlist'"
display "t0: `t0'"
display "id: `id'"
etc...</pre>

      <p>Ultimately it ended up that the command was:</p>

      <pre>. logrank _t _d, by(posttran) id(id) t0(_t0)
